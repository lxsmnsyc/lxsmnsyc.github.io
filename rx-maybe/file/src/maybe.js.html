/**
 * The Maybe class represents a deferred computation and emission of a single value,
 * no value at all or an exception.
 *
 * The Maybe class default consumer type it interacts with is the MaybeObserver via the
 * subscribe(MaybeObserver) method.
 *
 * The Maybe operates with the following sequential protocol:
 *
 * onSubscribe (onSuccess | onError | onComplete)?
 *
 * Note that onSuccess, onError and onComplete are mutually exclusive events;
 * unlike Observable, onSuccess is never followed by onError or onComplete.
 *
 * Like Observable, a running Maybe can be stopped through the Cancellable instance
 * provided to consumers through MaybeObserver.onSubscribe(Cancellable).
 *
 * Like an Observable, a Maybe is lazy, can be either &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;cold&quot;, synchronous or
 * asynchronous.
 *
 * The documentation for this class makes use of marble diagrams. The following
 * legend explains these diagrams:
